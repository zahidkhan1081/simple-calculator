# 🧮 Simple JavaScript Calculator

## Overview
This project is a fully functional, responsive calculator built using **vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3**. It specifically focuses on **DOM manipulation** and **event handling** to create an intuitive user interface.

As a Computer Science 4rth semester student, this project highlights my commitment to writing clean, organized, and functional code.

## 🔑 Key Features
* **Standard Arithmetic:** Supports all basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).
* **Responsive Design:** Utilizes modern CSS techniques to ensure the calculator layout adapts seamlessly to all screen sizes (desktop and mobile).
